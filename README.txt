For part two:
When you are in $SYSTEM (cs224n/pa1-mt/system), if you run command: "./runTimes.sh STDLog_TL_AU_SP.ini STDLog_TL_AU_SP 2 5", it will create 4 systems named STDLog_TL_AU_SP2, STDLog_TL_AU_SP3, STDLog_TL_AU_SP4, STDLog_TL_AU_SP5 with configuation file STDLog_TL_AU_SP.ini and put all the outputs into their corresponding directory.
