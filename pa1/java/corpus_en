construction is a principal economic activity in developing pudong . these years there have been several hundred construction companies and over four@@thousand construction sites that have spread out all over this stretch of hot turf .
when a construction company enters the region , first the appropriate bureau delivers these regulatory documents , and afterwards there is a specialized contingent that carries out a supervisory inspection .
in spite of the fact that of the regulatory documents that the pudong new region has formulated , some are relatively " crude " and some are still only provisional regulations awaiting step - by - step completion as they are put into practice , nevertheless , this kind of approach , with the legal system tightly coupled with economic and social activities , has received positive comments from domestic and foreign investors . they believe that in coming to the pudong new region to invest there is methodicalness and attention to rules in the handling of business and interests can receive safeguards .
