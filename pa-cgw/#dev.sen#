Arthur is the king .
Arthur rides the horse near the castle .
riding to Camelot is hard .
do coconuts speak ?
what does Arthur ride ?
who does Arthur suggest she carry ?
why does England have a king ?
are they suggesting Arthur ride to Camelot ?
five strangers are at the Round Table .
Guinevere might have known .
Guinevere should be riding with Patsy .
it is Sir Lancelot who knows Zoot !
either Arthur knows or Patsy does .
neither Sir Lancelot nor Guinevere will speak of it .
the Holy Grail was covered by a yellow fruit .
Zoot might have been carried by a swallow .
Arthur rode to Camelot and drank from his chalice .
they migrate precisely because they know they will grow .
do not speak !
Arthur will have been riding for eight nights .
Arthur , sixty inches , is a tiny king .
Arthur knows Patsy , the trusty servant .
Arthur and Guinevere migrate frequently .
he knows what they are covering with that story .
Arthur suggested that the castle be carried .
the king drank to the castle that was his home .
when the king drinks , Patsy drinks .
no corner carries that temperate defeater .
that castle will grow another quest below any sacred land .
each king can carry a pound and every quest could migrate that tropical
quest .
Sir Lancelot , a coconut covers a simple pound with that servant .
a sensational master should speak .
no sun will unfortunately ride no castle and no ants would migrate and
carry .
another winter drinks the weary servant into another winter .
no tropical swallow carries a weary winter .
each king drinks another plodding pound , but the sovereign drinks his
swallow .
each swallow rides its temperate defeater through either each corner or
his home .
